    "synopsis": "When veteran baseball commentator Artie Decker (Billy Crystal) gets his cards the last thing he wants to do is child-mind three grand-kids he hardly knows. It doesn't help that he and his wife Diane (Bette Midler) have no truck with 21st century parenting methods and haven't got a clue how to operate their daughter's hi-tech house's gadgets. Chaos ensues... but life lessons are learned in this raucous family comedy.",
    "body": "Billy Crystal plays put-out-to-graze baseball commentator Artie who reluctantly pitches up with his indulgent wife Diane (Midler) at the home of their daughter Alice (Tomei).\nThey've been cajoled into looking after their grand-kids - brainy 12-year-old Harper (Madison), stuttering wall-flower Turner (Rush) and the youngest, pocket rebel Barker (Breitkopf).\nWhile Alice and her gizmo-obsessed husband Artie (Everett Scott) head off for a few days at a resort, it's up to Artie and Diane - who hardly know their grandchildren - to hold the fort and nurture the nippers.\nA few bright lines crop up in this tired slave to formula but it's a largely dull affair relying on two stars who were once very much of the moment - from Throw Momma From The Train (Crystal) to Beaches (Midler) - but now seem to have lost their spark.\nThere's the expected pratfalls - Barker tinkling on skateboard legend Tony Hawke, a half-hearted food fight and a family bonding session during a game of kick-the-can in a rainstorm but in an era of Modern Family excellence it's pretty thin gruel.\nThings reach a low when Artie vomits in a child's face.\nFace it Billy, this isn't that funny.",

    "synopsis": "Widely regarded as Hitchcock's greatest work, this hypnotic mystery stars James Stewart as \u2018Scottie' Ferguson, a height-fearing ex-cop who is asked by an old friend to follow his oddly-behaving wife (Kim Novak). His curiosity leads to obsession, with devastating consequences. But that's only half the story. A haunting, striking and utterly compelling masterclass of technique and storytelling, Vertigo is so good it'll make your head spin.",
    "body": "Psycho delivered the shocks, North By Northwest the thrills and Rebecca the Oscar, but if one film can lay claim to the title of The Master's masterpiece, it's Vertigo.\nA seamless combination of psychological mystery, twisted romance, surrealism and technical innovation, it's the perfect embodiment of the Hitchcock motto: to mesmerise, unnerve and discombobulate.\nIn what was to be his last Hitch-up (his age was cited for the film's lukewarm box office), Stewart plays former San Francisco detective John Ferguson, whose nickname 'Scottie' is never explained... unlike his early retirement, the result of a rooftop chase during which Scottie - paralysed by acrophobia - watched helplessly as a fellow officer fell to his death.\nWhile his best friend Midge (Bel Geddes) helps him overcome both his condition and his guilty conscience, Scottie is contacted by Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), an old college buddy who wants him to follow his wife Madeleine (Novak).\nGavin is driven not by suspicion but concern. It seems that Madeleine is possessed by the spirit of an ancestor who committed suicide; visiting her grave, returning to her old home, and gazing for hours at her portrait in an art gallery.\nBut the observer is forced to turn saviour when Madeleine throws herself into San Francisco Bay. Beguiled and now completely besotted, he vows to solve the mystery and end her psychological torment forever.\nHis endeavours meet with tragic success.\nMonths later, Scottie is a haunted man. But a chance encounter on the street suggests that history is about to repeat itself...\nHaving written the source novel for the twisty French classic Les Diaboliques, authors Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac allegedly had Hitchcock in mind when they wrote the book D'entre les Morts (Back From The Dead) on which Vertigo is based. Deception and obsession are on the agenda once again.\nOften accused of treating actors like cattle, Hitchcock nevertheless brought out the best from his performers, particularly his leading ladies who were often cast for their (invariably blonde) looks over their acting ability.\nThe glacial Novak was never - and would never be - better than in her dual role here, while Barbara Bel Geddes may forever be remembered as Miss Ellie from Dallas, but her portrayal the loyal, loving Midge is a far worthier legacy.\nAnd while Stewart may have been a tad long in the tooth to convincingly sweep Novak off her feet, this is still one of his most layered performances, encompassing guilt, sadness, and an obsession that verges on the pitiable.\nIt's also impossible not to be seduced by Bernard Herrmann's marvellous score and the superb use of locations in and around San Francisco.\nOn top of all this, the film opened a cinematic box of tricks which are still used today, from Hitch's dizzying zoom in/pull back manoeuvre (capturing Scottie's acrophobia) to artist John Ferren's dream sequence, the influence of which can be seen in TV title sequences as diverse as Doctor Who and Mad Men.\nHitch freely admitted to plot developments that don't quite add up and leaving the odd loose end (think back to the hotel). He called them 'fridge moments', because if he'd done his job right, viewers would be so absorbed they would be safely home before they worked them out.\nBut make no mistake, Vertigo represents The Master at the height of his powers.",

    "synopsis": "After the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II, General Fellers (Lost's Matthew Fox) - an American officer with contacts behind the bamboo curtain - is tasked by General Douglas MacArthur (an impressive Tommy Lee Jones) with establishing whether Emperor Hirohito should face a war crimes trial. As a polished \u201cwho decided it\", this is an intriguing entry point into a fascinating period of Japanese/American history.",
    "body": "The investigation into Hirohito\u2019s war crimes complicity is a detective story worthy of Dashiell Hammett.\nSecluded in his heavily guarded palace, the emperor is protected by the heavy cloak of Japanese reticence in deference to their \u201cliving God\u201d, with numerous governmental flunkies (including Prime Minister Tojo) refusing to incriminate the figurehead.\nAll this is set against the backdrop of a country bombed into the Stone Age, with a shattered populace teetering on the brink of desperate anarchy. An anarchy that will erupt if the emperor is hung as a war criminal, but Washington is crying out for a conviction to appease voters baying for blood.\nThis component parts are present and correct in Emperor, but director Peter Webber cannot capture the momentousness of the period, falling back on the \u201cslot A into tab B\u201d dramatics in Vera Blasi and David Klass\u2019 script.\nFox\u2019s General Fellers is charged with uncovering the truth about Hirohito\u2019s culpability and ticks all politically sensitive boxes. An expert in Japanese culture and psychology following a pre-war liaison with a Japanese love interest (Hatsune), for whom he searches in the post-war rubble, Fox\u2019s expository role is heavy on dialogue labouring points about Japan\u2019s warrior spirit, honour and rigid rules of conduct.\nGolden-hued flashbacks to the lost love dissipate what little tension Webber can muster and there is little variation on the tight-lipped officials scenes that unfold one after the next until Fellers reaches someone willing to talk.\nTommy Lee Jones has more fun as the larger-than-life MacArthur, a man full of bravado and \u201cAmerican swagger\u201d who shrewdly distances himself from the investigation lest it ruin his Presidential campaign hopes.\nTokyo\u2019s devastated landscape is effectively rendered and flashbacks to the militaristic government\u2019s response to Hirohito\u2019s decision to surrender suggest a far more interesting story waits to be told.\nUndemanding, handsome and played with conviction, but sorely missing any sense of urgency.",

    "synopsis": "Almost fifteen years after providing a box office hit with The Best Man, Morris Chestnut, Taye Diggs, Regina Hall and the rest of their group of upwardly mobile African-Americans are back. In the intervening years, there have been marriages, births and divorces... and now they're all getting back for the Christmas holidays. Long-forgotten romances - and rivalries - are re-ignited as the wine flows. Speech!",
    "body": "Back in 1999,writer-director Malcolm D Lee hit box office gold with The Best Man, a cliche-free depiction of aspirational, middle class black Americans whose inspiration was less Shaft and more graft.\nWhen we left them Morris Chestnut's New York Giants running back Lance had just married Mia (Calhoun) despite her admitting an affair with Lance's best bud Harper (Diggs).\nFast-forward a decade and a half and there's still bad blood between Lance and Harper and the latter's career as a writer is on the wane and he's been fired from his university teaching job.\nHowever, he hits on the the sneaky idea of accepting an invite to a Christmas house party from Lance and Mia at their tacky mansion so that he can gather material for a warts'n'all unauthorised biography of the unsuspecting Giants star.\nDespite Lee's occasional tendency to soggy melodrama, his original film was a wry, entertaining take on a demographic previously overlooked -the black middle class - and spawned a whole flurry of similarly-themed fare, from the trite romance of Baggage Claim to the sharp, mating-game-turns-to-war comedy Think Like A Man.\nThis rom-com-dram take on The Big Chill isn't quite up there with Lee's debut but it never succumbs to the grim sudsiness waded through in Tyler Perry territory.\nWhere it does succeed is in the quality of the acting, particularly Terrence Howard's slightly ridiculous player Quentin, a nicely-played comedy distraction when the romantic drama is getting a tad too mawkish.\nLarger-than-life performances in a movie that deals in broad brush strokes also include Melissa De Sousa's Shelby, a upholstered bombshell and successful businesswoman who bitchily resents the former stripper who snared \"her man\".\nBut it's the fractured bromance between Chestnut and Diggs, a richly-worked love-hate relationship that provides the movie's real emotional ballast, an authentic test for a God-fearing alpha male to forgive his oldest friend.",

    "synopsis": "Multi-tasking Julie Delpy wrote, directed, edited, scored, produced and even found time to star in this wittily winning saga about a bickering couple spending a couple of days in Paris. Adam Goldberg plays the Manhattanite boyfriend fired by nervous energy while Delpy's own parents play a hilariously off-kilter version of themselves. Lovely stuff.",
    "body": "The idea of a couple of argumentative Yanks barrelling around Paris for a couple of days doesn't really sell itself as a must-see movie.\nYet Julie Delpy - along with Ethan Hawke - made the idea sing with the swooning romanticism of Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise and Before Sunset.\nHere she does every job bar making the tea in a similarly-styled, sophisticated talkathon with Adam Goldberg as the verbal sparring partner.\nDelpy plays American photographer Marion, a Paris-born girl-about-town whose conquests years before on home soil drive a wedge between her and her neurotic boyfriend Jack.\nHe's an interior designer ill-equipped to deal with a world beyond Manhattan who's increasingly disturbed by Marion's seemingly endless line of discarded ex-lovers.\nTo further disorientate him, Marion's family - with whom they are staying during a two-day stopover - provide him with the perfect excuse for catching the next flight out.\nDad's an erotic painter who revels in keying cars that have been parked on the pavement while his wife derives much pleasure from copping an eyeful of a naked Jack in a photo rather ungallantly shown to her by her daughter.\nThere's a wittily acidic quality to Delpy's writing about a relationship that's clearly out of the early silly energy stage and two years down the line into bitter recrimination.\nThis is a rom-com with an authentically bitter aftertaste. It's also very funny.",

    "synopsis": "Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker) is a black butler who works his way up from poverty to join the White House backroom staff in the 1950s, as a lowly pantry man. Serving eight presidents over three decades, Cecil rises through the ranks, present at some of the biggest decisions in history. His son, meanwhile, finds himself on the cusp of the fledgling civil rights movement. A frank and moving look at race, politics and family in 20th-century America.",
    "body": "Eugene Allen joined the backroom staff of the White House in 1952 as a lowly pantry man. By his retirement in 1986, he was the head butler, having served under eight US presidents, admired and respected by politicians and staff alike.\nIt\u2019s Allen\u2019s story which loosely inspires The Butler, his name - and backstory - changed for dramatic embellishment. Forest Whitaker plays the softly spoken servant - here renamed Cecil Gaines - who swiftly rises through the White House ranks; Britain\u2019s David Oyelowo plays his rebellious activist son Louis.\nThrough Louis, we are given a potted history of America\u2019s fledgling civil rights movement: from its humble beginnings in nonviolent diner sit-ins, through to the radical militantism of the Black Panthers.\nDaniels\u2019 depiction of this era is well-balanced, gripping, and often electrifying. Occasional snippets of real-life media solidify the significance of the movement.\nCecil\u2019s unique vantage point - a front row seat behind-the-scenes of a superpower - is certainly fascinating, and the typically American fondness for mythologising presidents allows for some fun cameos, including Robin Williams, Alan Rickman, and John Cusack (the latter sporting a daft prosthetic snout).\nAs Precious proved, Lee Daniels is an actor\u2019s director, and there are stunning turns from the whole cast - particularly from Oyelowo and Oprah Winfrey (devastatingly brilliant as Cecil\u2019s alcoholic wife).",

    "synopsis":"The idyllic life of Libby Parsons (Ashley Judd) turns into a nightmare when her husband disappears overboard during a sailing weekend. Things get worse when she is convicted of his murder - but is he really dead and has she been the victim of an elaborate conspiracy? The intriguing premise is that you can never be convicted of the same crime twice.",
    "body":"Director Bruce Beresford last hit the big-time when he paired Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman in Driving Miss Daisy.\nWhile he didn't scoop any Oscars for Double Jeopardy, Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones proved to be every bit as lethal a combination at the US box office.\nThe story is that of a woman, Libby (Judd), who is convicted of her husband's (Greenwood) murder and accordingly sentenced to prison.\nWhile there, she discovers that her husband is, in fact, alive and kicking; and, when informed of the double jeopardy law (that no one can be tried for the same crime twice), she decides to serve her time and exact some revenge.\nJudd finds herself in the kind of role usually reserved for muscle-bound action heroes, spending her time behind bars working out and training for revenge.\nLibby emerges from jail looking, if anything, even more gorgeous than she did when she was locked up.\nShe's assigned to a halfway house, where her parole officer is a hard-bitten man of few and succinct words, played by Tommy Lee Jones.\nTheir scenes together are good ones and, when she feeds him the same heartfelt lines that worked with the parole board, he barks, as only Tommy Lee Jones can: \"I'm not interested in your contrition. I'm interested in your behaviour. Get out of here and behave yourself.\"\nIn an obvious effort to keep Libby from being too cold-blooded, her main motive to find her husband is not to settle the score, but merely to see her son again.\nThe presence of Judd in the lead does go a long way in keeping the film entertaining.",

    "synopsis":"A fly-on-the-wall glimpse into the showbiz world of American popstrel (and Russell Brand's ex-squeeze) during her latest tour. A whirlwind tour of her past takes us back to her strict religious upbringing, her stop-start career trajectory in LA and, finally, global triumph with her smart pop songs and bubblegum persona. It's also a major slice of luck that the documentary begins - and ends with - Perry's doomed marriage to Brand.",
    "body":"From the makers of last year's Justin Bieber: Never Say Never comes this new pop tour doc about California Gurl Katy Perry, following the pop sensation as she embarks on a massive world tour.\nIt's a neatly packaged, good-looking affair which intersperses prep and performances from the tour itself with talking heads, past footage and, of course, interviews with the ever effervescent Perry herself.\n\"Everyone thinks she's a puppet, that her success came out of nowhere, but that's not the case at all,\" coos her loyal sister, who is also part of an entourage that genuinely all seem to get along.\nCue flashbacks of Perry's past, including the well-known - her Pentecostal background and her supportive but slightly scandalised minister parents, and the less well-known -  she moved to L. A. in her teens.\nThere, she was dropped by not one, not two but three record labels before finally finding success and going on to become the first woman ever to achieve five number one singles from one album and only the second person in he world to do so after Michael Jackson.\nWhatever you think of Perry's brand of bubblegum pop and cartoon costumes, this is not a success story even the hardest of hearts can begrudge.\nPerry's innate likeability and charisma is the first of two things that make this documentary more watchable than it might otherwise be. The other is the ghost of Russell Brand.\nSometimes documentary makers just luck out, and in this case they have, at the very painful expense of the film's subject. The tour - and the cameramen - began within months of Perry's lavish wedding to the British comedian. By the time the tour and film are up, divorce is on its way.\nBrand only pops up on a couple of occasions, and looks like a rabbit in headlights when he does (the comedian reportedly asked for footage with him in it to be edited out), but the lack of him casts a shadow.\nIt's clear whose side the film is on, as Perry flies back and forth to meet Brand wherever he is, before she finally succumbs to tears of exhaustion and heartbreak.\nThe one truly poignant moment of the whole film comes when Perry dons a robotic smile as she is ferried on to the stage, moments after a bout of hysterical crying. Would the film have worked without this perspective? Perhaps not.",

This is that rarity in films - an all-action, no-frills, straightforward re-creation of an heroic moment in history.",
    "body":"This is that rarity in films - an all-action, no-frills, straightforward re-creation of an heroic moment in history.\nOn this occasion, the action concerns the Zulu wars in South Africa and, in particular, the electrifying Battle of Rorke's Drift in 1879.\nThis is where little more than 100 men of the South Wales Borderers made a staggeringly brave stand against 4000 yelling Zulu warriors, who had just massacred a force of over 1,000 British troops.\nIt is in the supporting roles that the film finds its own strength. James Booth, as the malingering Private Hook, Nigel Green, as the colour-sergeant, Ivor Emmanuel (in his only film appearance) and Kerry Jordan (the camp cook) all give exemplary service.\nAnd then-newcomer Michael Caine is so impressive it's amazing he wasn't snapped up for more star roles long before The Ipcress File two years later.\nThe last few scenes, as rank after rank of the last defenders pour leaden defiance at the Zulus from a few yards' range, are pulsatingly thrilling.",

Thankfully, beefcake Marc Blucas is on hand to guide her along the rocky road. Look out for Jay Leno and Joan Rovers in comedy cameos in this directorial effort from actor Forest Whitaker.",
    "body":"Compared to our own happy-go-lucky young royals, American president's daughter Katie Holmes is a bit of slouch in the hellraising stakes.\nSure, she gets tipsy and dances on a table... but she draws the line at stumbling into the street and lurching at waiting snappers. She also doesn't dress up in a Nazi uniform.\nIn fact, compared to our delinquent bluebloods, the riskiest thing she seems to get up to is being taller than her dad. But we are talking about Michael Keaton.\nEven so, when your home is 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue (aka The White House) and the only parties you're aware of are the Democrats and Republicans, college can seem pretty daunting.\nGetting off on the wrong foot with feisty roommate Mia (r'n'b star Amerie) doesn't help. Neither does having two Secret Service goons posted outside your door 24/7.\nHope comes in the rippling form of beefcake Marc Blucas, the resident advisor (no idea what that is) in her college dorm.",

    "synopsis":"Landmark Western starring Gary Cooper as a small-town marshal whose wedding day is ruined when news comes through that a murderous gang will be arriving on the midday train. As the minutes tick by, the timorous townsfolk head for the hills, leaving Coop a man alone. Even his girl Grace Kelly has doubts about standing by her man (hence the Oscar-winning song 'Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darling'). Director Fred Zinnemann keeps trigger fingers twitching by running the clock down in real time, while chief villain Lee Van Cleef never says a word. Terrific.",
    "body":"Fred Zinnemann's suspense Western is a classic, with Oscar-winning Gary Cooper at his grimmest and best as the town marshal deserted by everyone, including his new Quaker bride, Grace Kelly.\nIt won three other Oscars, including one for the famous title song (the first Oscar-winning song from a non-musical), sung by Tex Ritter, which sweeps along and intensifies the drama.\nThomas Mitchell, Katy Jurado and Lee Van Cleef (without dialogue) also make notable contributions to the film which runs in real time, with everything taking place between 10. 30am and the shootout which follows the arrival of the noon train.\nThe real time effect was spoilt in re-editing, cutting the running time from 100 minutes to 85. Cooper's grimness wasn't all acting: he had a bleeding ulcer and a bad back. John Wayne said the film was unpatriotic.",

    "synopsis": "Just what all you sick puppies have been begging for - another nasty shaggy dog story from the guy who gave us all Cabin Fever. Three lustful backpackers learn of a hostel in Eastern Europe where the local girls will do anything for foreigners. The rumour turns out to be true... but why do people keep leaving without a word? Book in for torture, oceans of gore and vicious street urchins; Eli Roth's notorious sado-nasty does for InterRailing what Titanic did for sea cruises.",
    "body": "Produced by Quentin Tarantino, Hostel is the latest exercise in gratuitous blood-letting from Cabin Fever director Eli Roth.\nAs the opening credits roll, the sight of blood, flesh and teeth being rinsed down filthy drains is ideal preparation for the kind of grisly yarn where nobody ends up with their full complement of body parts.\nOur hapless heroes are Paxton (Hernandez) and Josh (Richardson), two horny Americans trekking around Europe with Icelandic buffoon Oli (Gudjonsson) in search of strong weed and loose women.\nThey find the former in Amsterdam and learn that they can get as much of the latter as their loins desire at an obscure hostel somewhere near Bratislava.\nOn arrival, it seems that all their (wet) dreams have come true. Local attractions include delicious, sauna-loving roomies Natalya (Nedeljakova) and Svetlana (Kaderabkova), and Pax and Josh waste no time in exploring their charms.\nThe next morning, Oli has gone. But the time for real concern comes after another night out when Josh regains consciousness shackled to a chair in a medieval chamber, surrounded by steel instruments. Not good.\nAnd when a sadist in a butcher's apron purrs \"I al-vays vonted to be a surgeon\", it's time to scream.\nYou see, this is where innocent hostellers become the playthings of a global cabal of ultra-rich sickos - a fact that Paxton discovers all too late.\nRoth got the idea after chatting with internet heavyweight Harry Knowles about the sickest thing they had seen on the web.\nSo as the Daily Wail prepares its \"Ban this sick film!\" campaign, it's worth remembering that we live in a world where scenes of torture are everyday news, real executions can be downloaded at will and people queue round the block for the London Dungeons.\nLike it or not, Roth is merely pandering to our fascination with gore. And he has a nailed-on talent for making gorges rise and neck-hairs bristle (enhanced here by Nathan Barr's Psycho-style score).\nBetter skip that popcorn because Hostel is the movie equivalent of sticking two fingers down the back of your throat.",

Then the real trouble begins.\nSince every detail about the film seems right, it all becomes far too close for comfort, even if it's set in far-away Austria and the director makes increasingly frequent 'it's only a movie' flourishes.\nSuch clever film-making and performing at the service of a sick-making story leaves the audience very queasy indeed.",

    "synopsis": "Visionary director Guillermo Del Toro goes mega with this sci-fi blockbuster featuring humungous monsters - Kaiju - rising from the depths of the Pacific Ocean and threatening to take over the planet. Mankind fights back with giant robots - Jaegers - controlled neurally by air force pilots led by Jaeger master Idris Elba. But even they seem to be fighting a losing battle. Step forward potential saviours ex-flier Charlie Hunnam and untested trainee Rinko Kikuchi. Transformers get wet in this bone-jarring metallic monster movie.",
    "body": "Godzilla collides noisily with Transformers in this spectacular ruck that pits alien behemoths - kaiju - rising from the ocean depths against mighty multi-storey robots - jaegers - protecting mankind.\nThe kaiju, who sporadically emerge ever stronger and more devious from a portal in a crevasse beneath the Pacific Ocean, are winning the war against man, making short work of his paltry defences. Basically, a big wall.\nDespite early successes, the jaegers - commanded by Idris Elba's splendidly monikered Stacker Pentecost - are being out-manoevred and out-thought to such an extent that those in charge are considering giving up on them completely.\nYet Stacker still has faith, buys some time and recruits former pilot Raleigh Becket (Hunnam), a washed-up 'bot warrior who lost his brother during an oceanic duel with a kaiju off the coast of Alaska five years before.\nHe joins a united nations of giant, lumbering jaegers - America's Gipsy Danger, Russia's Cherno Alpha, China's Crimson Typhoon, Australia's Strike Eureka and Wales' The Big Leek. Perhaps not the last one.\nJoining him at the controls is untested trainee Mako Mori (Kikuchi), the two of them literally reading each other's minds via a neural bridge called The Drift.\nIt would have helped to have had two brains while trying to work out the masses of hardware thrashing about on screen as the CGI whizz-kids go into giddy overdrive.\nFans of hi-tech dust-ups from Transformers to Battleship will be familiar with attention-deficit action maelstrom and director Del Toro - on his biggest movie yet - shows Michael Bay hasn't got the monopoly on a frantic, broadscreen visuals.\nUnfortunately, it serves to underscore that the director is at his most darkly effective on a small canvas with the likes of Pan's Labyrinth and The Devil's Backbone conveying a surreal depth completely missing from this corporate blockbuster.\nIt's by no means a bad film... but there's not a trace of Del Toro's compellingly off-kilter dabs on it.",

    "synopsis": "Comedy writer John Hughes' directing debut stars his muse Molly Ringwald as a gauche teenager with dreams of a perfect romance. Fellow Brat-Packer and Breakfast Clubber Anthony Michael Hall co-stars, and there are spot-the-rising-star roles for John Cusack and his big sister Joan.",
    "body": "This first film as a director from writer John Hughes, who cut his teeth on National Lampoon comedies, struck a chord with teenagers. Hughes found a way to tap into their neuroses, anxieties and dreams and put them over in the language of the moment.\nHe also discovered a new leading actress in carrot-topped Molly Ringwald, who went on to play the same sort of role in Hughes' follow-up films, The Breakfast Club and Pretty in Pink. But when their friendship foundered, she turned down Laura Dern's star-making role in David Lynch's Wild at Heart (on the advice of her mother! ) a bad decision from which her career has never recovered.\nSixteen Candles is basically about a girl becoming a young woman - and having the worst day of her life. The film bubbles along nicely but the greatest fun today can be found in spotting future stars in the supporting cast, including brother and sister Joan and John Cusack and Jami Gertz (who later co-starred in Twister).",

    "synopsis": "In this Jackass spin-off, Johnny Knoxville plays 86-year-old Irving Zisman, a sex-obsessed octogenarian who takes his eight-year-old grandson Billy (Jackson Nicoll) on a road trip to meet his estranged, deadbeat father. During their journey, Irving takes time out to party with male strippers, make romantic overtures to bingo players and persuade Billy to enter a beauty pageant. Ribald laughs come thick and fast as Johnny and team con the public with a series of out-there stunts. Sky Movies is showing the extended cut.",
    "body": "The fourth big screen Jackass outing sees the crazed jape-meisters exchanging the usual plot-less series of painful stunts for candid-camera-style stings on oblivious members of the public.\nThe Borat-style narrative framing - featuring MTV sketch show regular Irving Zisner (Knoxville), an 86-year-old, sex-addicted widow, escorting his eight-year-grandson (Fun Size's Nicoll) across America - allows the pranksters full reign to play practical jokes on unwary blue collar stooges, who invariably emerge from their ordeal with their humour intact.\nThis is where this strays away from Sacha Baron Cohen's satirical vehicle. All Knoxville's targets - well-meaning bikers, amiable black male strippers, affable removal men - are just ordinary joes going about their business whereas Borat pointed up the racism, prejudice and hateful red-neckery that often thrives just below the surface.\nThe one gag that goes against the easy-laughs grain - where Billy is pursuaded to enter a beauty pageant only to switch to a lewd stage show half way through - works... but worked better in Little Miss Sunshine.\nSome of the stunts amuse - Zisner catapulted through the window of a bedroom showroom on a child's amusement ride is simple but effective. However, the spiel becomes repetitive - how many times can randy Irving proposition uninterested young women?\nThe premise also soon begins to jar with the fictitious relationship between Irving and young Billy sitting awkwardly with Jackass-style stunts that appear to have been crow-barred into the road trip narrative.\nExisting fans of the franchise will find much to enjoy - particularly scenes featuring Irving's genitals either trapped in a soda machine or swinging around his knees during a trip to a strip club hen night.",

    "synopsis": "The late Paul Walker's last big screen appearance proper sees him play an undercover cop who hooks up with a free-running rebel (David Belle) to take on a Detroit crime lord (RZA) plotting to detonate a neutron bomb. Co-written by Luc Besson, this remake of the French thriller District 13 serves up preposterous action, including bundles of heart-stopping parkour.",
    "body": "Paul Walker teams up with parkour prince David Belle for his last completed big screening outing (ahead of Fast & Furious 7), a suitably frenetic action remake relocated from Paris to Detroit.\nBelle reprises his character - a free-running anti-mob hero - from the French thriller District 13 while Walker plays Damien Collier, an athletic undercover cop seeking revenge for the death of his father.\nThe find themselves unlikely allies in Brick Mansions, a vast, derelict Detroit housing project that has been walled off by the city authorities who have big plans to turn it into a lucrative yuppie development.\nThe desolate manor is ruled over by dope kingpin Tremaine (RZA), a ruthless overlord who is massively hacked off by Belle's Lino after a big stash of cocaine was washed down the plughole by the anti-drugs crusader.\nHe kidnaps Lino's ex-friend Lola (Denis) as a means of getting to him but remains unaware that Collier has been tasked with infiltrating Tremaine's degenerate empire and shutting him down. There's also the small problemette that the mobster has pinched a neutron bomb and has strapped it to a missile pointed downtown.\nIf you can look beyond the preposterous nature of this cartoonish retread, there's fun to be had thanks to a series of inventive action setpieces, particularly showcasing Belle's gravity-defying abilities to bounce off buildings and launch himself off walls.\nWalker just about keeps up the pace and his pomposity-free demeanour works well to offset a story that bursts with ghetto cliches - from the fish-netted vamp to legions of swaggering punks bristling with lethal hardware.\nIt will never trouble the esteemed members of the Academy... but that probably wouldn't have bothered Paul Walker too much.",

    "synopsis": "Flawless performances from Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson form the emotional core of Merchant-Ivory's adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro's tale of repressed love in an English manor in the 1930s. Hopkins is the butler whose feelings for Thompson's housekeeper cause him to question the personal sacrifices he has made during a lifetime of subservience, loyalty and propriety. The overwhelming class and resonance of the piece is enough to reduce Downton Abbey to rubble.",
    "body": "Merchant-Ivory's beautifully crafted film is a very English piece, full of choked-back, unspoken emotions. Anthony Hopkins is perfectly cast as the uptight butler in a 1930s stately home, where the housekeeper (Emma Thompson) forms a relationship with him that develops into one of mutual respect and affection, which he can't express.\nRuth Prawer Jhabvala's screenplay, faithful to Kazuo Ishiguro's book, arrows unerringly to a heartrending conclusion. Brilliant performances by the principals are backed up by good support, especially from Peter Vaughan as butler's father.\nEight Oscar nominations but no wins.\nReview from IPC.",

    "synopsis": "The British urban drama gets an intriguing twist in this story of two brothers from an Egyptian family attempting to escape the gang culture that pollutes their East London estate. James Floyd delivers a standout performance as the charismatic Rashid, a smalltime drug dealer who is determined that his younger brother Mo (Fady Elsayed) isn't going to follow in his footsteps. Director Sally El Hosaini has crafted a grimly authentic glimpse into gang lore which also has the courage to tackle the vexed question of sexuality in a risibly macho culture.",
    "body": "Tackling the reality of British urban gang culture complicated as it is by both race and religion without hitting a wrong note or sliding into cliche has traditionally been a big ask of even the most accomplished director.\nSo for debut feature helmer Sally El Hosaini to chuck the strict taboo of homosexuality into an already over-complex gangsta stew appears to be throwing dramatic caution to the wind.\nExcitingly, her elegant, poetic approach pays real dividends with controversial themes and issues dealt with simply and subtly to provide a genuinely authentic insight into a mob experience that dare not speak its name.\nJames Floyd plays Rashid, a swaggering East End dealer whose dubious activities cause his doting Egyptian immigant parents sleepless nights but impress his younger brother Mo (Elsayed), a gauche teen at a crossroads in his life.\nRashid's a minor player for the DMG crew (Drugs, Money, Guns)... but he's got all the accoutrements - the bling, the ready cash and the gorgeous, compliant girlfriend.\nHowever, everything changes when his best buddy Izzi (Welsh), a disenchanted gang member who wants out, is knifed to death in a turf confrontation with DMG's arch-nemesis Demon.\nRashid rages but eschews revenge... and gets a job with one of Izzi's contacts, successful French photographer Sayyid (Taghmaoui), who introduces him to a glamorous demi-monde, worlds away from macho gang life.\nHowever, Mo falls into Rashid's vacuum and is recruited as a street level drugs hustler as the war between the rival factions ignites into lethal violence.",

    "synopsis": "Welcome to the jungle for the real-life fun and games of a young chimp called Oscar, as captured by the team behind Disney documentaries Earth and African Cats. Narrated with anthropomorphic zeal by Tim Allen, it's a wild, funny, and occasionally alarming adventure showing that survival is not only a tricky learning curve, but sometimes requires a bit of luck. High drama and sumptuous imagery makes it an eye-opening experience for all.",
    "body": "At about the same time the young David Attenborough was making televised natural history with Zoo Quest, Disney was also making strides into the wonderful world of documentaries with its ground-breaking True-Life Adventures.\nBut while Attenborough\u2019s approach - and by extension, the BBC\u2019s - has always been to simply show and tell, Disney generally prefers to take the anthropomorphic route, forever painting animal behaviour in a human light.\nThus as former BBC filmmakers working under the Disneynature banner (for the second time after Earth), Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield find themselves somewhere in the middle.\nThe middle of the Ivory Coast rainforest, to be exact, to bring us the story of Oscar the infant chimpanzee.\nWe follow Oscar as he learns the art of survival from his mother and the wider social group, from hunting monkeys and mastering the use of tools (always a tough nut to crack) to the serious business of mucking about and annoying one\u2019s elders.\nBut it\u2019s not all japes for the apes, as a tragedy comes out of nowhere to leave Oscar\u2019s future in the balance. Fortunately, he\u2019s saved by an extraordinary act of alpha-male behaviour that has never previously been caught on film.\nClever editing enhances the drama, while time-lapse sequences and crystal-clear photography complete a captivating picture of jungle life.\nCanopies shrouded in mist; fantastical, night-time displays of luminous fungi; vast, living carpets made entirely of ants. Technically, Chimpanzee is a marvellous achievement. However...\nRaising awareness of the natural world is hugely important. And there\u2019s no harm in putting it into human context, especially for kids who may never have ventured outside urban area.\nBut, as delivered by the jovial Tim Allen, Chimpanzee's script is so heavily humanised it gives the idea that wild animals should be viewed in the same way as people. Which is somewhat reckless.\nParticularly galling is the incessant portrayal of the rival chimp group as bad guys. Where Oscar\u2019s clan is led by the \u201cwise and experienced\u201d Freddy and carefully referred to in the passive (\u201cteam\u201d, \u201csociety\u201d, \u201cfamily\u201d), the bunch from beyond the ridge and their fearsome leader Scar (no Trevors or Kevins here) are a relentlessly aggressive \u201cmob\u201d, \u201carmy\u201d and \u201cgang\u201d.\nWe\u2019re all rooting for Oscar, so why present his natural competitors as evil? After all, they only want the same thing.\nIf you want another Lion King, make another Lion King. Real life is about survival of the fittest, not the cutest.",

The kids aren't thrilled about being uprooted; especially to a new home in the middle of America's dullest suburb, where the schools all suck.\nBut Tom's problems really begin when Kate goes on a national tour to promote her book and he's left to run two teams: one on the field and one at home.\nThe uptight neighbours have but one child, and he's a freak. And Ashton Kutcher (uncredited - is he that big a star now? ) plays a boyfriend who doesn't like or want kids, so they make him into a shallow, self-absorbed moron.\nThough it's nicely cast (astutely pandering to the teen audience with TV pin-ups Tom Welling - of Smallville - and Lizzie McGuire star Hilary Duff), we've seen all the characters and set-ups many times before.

    "synopsis": "Pixar's pre-eminence as the children's animation king gets a right royal challenge from this computer-generated feast of fun. Based on the popular American children's book, this features a socially-inept inventor who builds a bizarre contraption that turns water into grub. However, a malfunction gives the food processor-from-hell a mind of its own and the little island of Chewandswallow faces extinction under a supersized serving of scran. A barking banquet of warmth and wit.",
    "body": "If you feel you haven't got the stomach for yet another computer-animated feature then this tasty treat could well cleanse your jaded palate.\nDebut feature writer-directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller have served up a mouth-watering adaptation of Judi Barrett's children's story where food bizarrely falls out of the sky.\nFlint Lockwood (voiced by Bill Hader) is a young oddball inventor whose hare-brained offerings include spray-on shoes (you can't get them off) and a monkey thought translator (not really that useful - all simians think about is food).\nHowever, living on a grey island where the staple food is sardines fried, poached, grilled, roasted and raw, he has high hopes for a microwave on steroids which can turn water into grub.\nUnfortunately, his first big public demonstration - attended by work experience weather girl Sparks (Faris) - ends in disaster when his contraption destroys the town square and rockets off into the clouds.\nIt looks like game over... until cheeseburgers begin falling like rain.\nThe concept of various foodstuffs tumbling from the ether proves to be manna from heaven for the film-makers whose CGI technology vividly captures everything from snowfields of ice cream to meatball boulders demolishing everything in their path.\nHowever, it's the concentration on helpings of rich characterisation that is the cherry on top of a confection thriving on the wittily surreal.\nMr T - yes him - makes a beefy fist of voicing Earl, the overprotective town cop, Faris is fine as the sunny weathergirl while Bruce Campbell gets his teeth into the role of the greedily obese mayor.\nBy the end even kids suffering ADDs will be overwhelmed as Flint and the gang take on a gloriously surreal buffet of predatory giant chickens and psychopathic jelly babies. Weird but very wonderful.\nFeast on it.",

(The Karate Kid was originally one of DC Comics' Legion of Superheroes).",
    "body": "After 'Rocky', it's Rocky Junior.\nDirector John G Avildsen has taken the same basic elements that made his boxing film such a success and cunningly crafted them to a seven-stone-weakling-style yarn about Danny (Ralph Macchio).\nHe's a 15-year-old whose meagre karate training is of no use against the local motorcycle gang, whose leader (the ex of the girl Danny fancies) doubles up as the school bully.\nAs he and his friends are members of the 'no mercy' local karate school, Danny's education is proving a painful one until he meets Mr Miyagi, the repair man at his flats, who proves, not unexpectedly, to be a karate expert and helps Danny train for the local championships.\nNot exactly full of surprises, but it's a pleasingly engaging experience for all.\nAttractive Elisabeth Shue seems a trifle mature for our teenage hero, but the film is in any case stolen by veteran Pat Morita as Miyagi, who makes the most of the film's good lines.\nTelling Danny to win back his girlfriend, he advises: 'To make honey, bee need young flower, not old prune.'

    "body": "An impulse buy while on holiday in Italy is normally confined to a wooden Pinnochio puppet, a Chianti bottle wrapped in raffia or a bottle of olive oil.\nNewly-divorced American literary professor Frances Mayes (Lane) goes one further - she buys a villa after fleetingly glancing at the property from a tourist bus.\nShell-shocked from her marriage split, speaking no Italian and unsure why she made the rash purchase in the first place, it looks like a big mistake.\nBut by slowly getting to know her neighbours and embarking on a restoration scheme with a gang of comedy Polish labourers, she rediscovers the pleasures of life.\nLoosely based on the best-selling novel by the real-life Frances Mayes, this is dollops of sentimentality served like ladles of Italian ice cream.\nIt's a shamelessly romanticised world of gelato-guzzling nuns, honey-coloured stone churches in poppy fields and bambinos clustering around red Ferraris.\nLane herself seems to making a pitch for Meg Ryan's rom-com mantle, which means pouting winsomely and giggling through life's adversities.\nEven before leaving San Francisco, the stereotypes are present and correct with  Frances' best buddy an Asian lesbian single-mum model of political correctness.\nIn Italy, it doesn't get much better with sleek romeos seemingly tumbling out of Cornetto commercials to give Frances the eye.\nEstate agent Signor Martini (Vincent Riotta) would like to live up to his name and take a tumble with Frances anytime, any place anywhere - if he wasn't married with two kids.\nDuncan lives la dolce vita as the sort of free-spirited British vamp delighting the locals but whose fingers you'd like to ram into a pasta machine.\nEven the most Barbara Cartland fixated cinama-goer - who this is presumably pitched at - would find the romantic idyll difficult to swallow. Tuscany looks nice, though.",

    "synopsis": "Every year, thousands of Emperor penguins trudge over 70 miles of ice to their Antarctic breeding grounds. And that's the easy part. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, this Best Documentary Feature Oscar-winner commands incredible displays of determination, stamina, teamwork, loss and devotion from its freeze-resistant stars. Often regarded as figures of fun, these creatures really deserve our utmost admiration and respect.",
    "body": "Q: What's black and white and made America's major studios green all over?\nA: An $8 million documentary about penguins that finished higher in the box office pecking order than many of 2005s mass-marketed blockbusters.\nOver one mating season, we follow a 'clan' of Emperors as they migrate to a place relatively free of predators where the ice won't thaw too early.\nOnce there, each finds a mate, then the happy couple wait for their courtship to bear fruit. When it does, custody of the egg passes carefully from female to male and she makes the long trip back to the sea for food.\nFather now oversees the incubation and hatching process until mother returns. Then, after over four months without food, he gets to make the 140-mile relay.\nMost of this takes place in near-permanent darkness and in temperatures low enough to sterilise brass monkeys (minus 70 degrees before taking into account the nigh-on 100mph windchill factor). Inevitably, many eggs, chicks and adults don\u2019t survive. Fun, no?\nFor a warm-blooded species to exist in such a harsh environment is one of the more unfathomable quirks of evolution. But despite all the hardship and heartache on show, this beautifully shot film is always rewarding and often a lot of fun.\nThe chicks are adorable but people reserve a soft spot for penguins because of their uncannily, comically human-like behaviour. To see them marching single-file across the icy wastes is like watching so many marathon runners all wearing the same costume.\nAnd the scenes of huge protective huddles and frequent acts of tenderness are enough to melt hearts in the fiercest snowstorm.\nCome the awards season, don\u2019t bet against this family-friendly venture from p-p-p-picking up a Best Documentary gong or two.",

    "synopsis": "Following the fairytale success of Snow White, Disney's second feature brings to life another children's classic: Carlo Collodi's story of a wooden puppet who dreams of being \"a real boy\". Fashioned by lonely carpenter Geppetto, Pinocchio is given his chance to become human by a fairy who tells him he must remain truthful and unselfish, which means listening to his conscience - embodied by a fellow called Jiminy Cricket. But if their many adventures prove anything, it's that boys will be boys - real or otherwise. No word of a lie, family movies don't come more enchanting than this. It was also music to the Academy Awards... the score and song When You Wish Upon A Star both landed an Oscar.",
    "body": "Still perhaps Disney's best single-story cartoon, this tale of a little wooden boy is vividly related and crammed with adventures (some a little frightening for the very young).\nMemorable characters abound: Geppetto the woodcarver, Jiminy Cricket, Figaro and Cleo (a cat and a goldfish), and the villains J Worthington Foulfellow (a fox), Gideon (an alleycat), Stromboli the showman and the terrifying coachman.\nTeeming with detail, it even had an Oscar-winning song: 'When You Wish Upon A Star'.",

    "synopsis": "Paul Giamatti is an award-winning shambles as Barney Panofsky, a fickle TV producer whose three marriages turn out as eventful as his shows, only not quite as successful. Adapted from Canadian author Mordecai Richler's last novel, Barney's Version takes a bleakly funny look at the life and romantically rocky times of a self-made fool. Minnie Driver and Rosamund Pike make perfect opposites as wives two and three, while Dustin Hoffman enjoys himself as Barney's crass but supportive dad. Superbly acted and a wee bit maudlin, it's a bona-fide weepie for men.",
    "body": "Returning to the booze-fuelled anti-heroics of Sideways, Paul Giamatti slumps resplendently once more onto the throne of Indieland as Barney, the ageing honcho of the astutely named Totally Unnecessary Productions.\nBased on the last navel-gazing wheeze of Mordecai Richler \u2013 author of that other seminal tale of Canadian Jewishness, The Apprenticeship Of Duddy Kravitz \u2013 the film takes us through Barney's life as a husband (three times), father, drunk, liar, cheat, and murder suspect.\nBut don't get him wrong. Barney is just a regular guy who too often meets the right people at the wrong time. Or catches the wrong people at a bad time. And who rarely learns from his mistakes.\nSo after a tragically short-lived marriage to a floozy he thought he'd knocked up in Rome (Twilight temptress Rachelle Lefevre), Barney returns to Montreal and tries again with a prattling Jewish princess (Driver).\nAnd on their wedding day, he finally fall in love. With someone else. But things will be different with Miriam (Pike). So beautiful, loving, understanding and kind, he would be a fool to let this one go.\nBut a fool he is.\nHe's also a mass of contradictions, prone to as many acts of love and loyalty as he is to subterfuge and selfishness. And despite following Jewish traditions, he never looks for any kind of spiritual guidance.\nIf ever a man needed a moral compass, it's Barney. But while his dad Izzy (Hoffman) always tells it like it is, he often goes too far \u2013 as he did back when he was a cop.\nAnd his best friend Boogie (Scott Speedman) is a drug-addicted liability. Which is how Miriam and Barney end up together \u2013 and why Barney spends the rest of his life in an unsolved murder mystery.\nAs channelled by screenwriter Michael Konyves, Richler's tale is not short of mordant delights - delivered courtesy of a faultless ensemble. Driver peps up every scene while Hoffman is at his avuncular best and Pike is too good to be true. Too good for Barney anyway.\nBut the gloom is inescapable and the sense that poor old Barney is cursed to see everything slip away is made horribly manifest come the final reckoning.\nIt's a bittersweet pill. But with fluid direction from Richard J. Lewis and Giamatti in mesmerising form, Barney's medicine is remarkably easy to take.\nWere you a fan of Paul Giamatti in Sideways? Is Rosamund Pike getting the roles she deserves? Will you be checking this out? Discuss this review on our Facebook page and Twitter stream.\nRead more Sky Movies film reviews here.",

    "synopsis": "Derek Luke plays an apolitical black South African refinery foreman who was radicalised into joining the anti-apartheid ANC following his false arrest and torture. Tim Robbins is the Afrikaner police colonel and family man whose easy-going charisma masks a brutal sadist who will stop at nothing to uphold white rule.",
    "body": "This sobering tale of the armed struggle against apartheid reaches the big screen by virtue of a personal recommendation from the legendary South African ANC lieutenant Joe Slovo.\nSlovo, whose daughter Shawn penned the script, insisted that if there was one story worth telling from that volatile period it was Patrick Chamusso's.\nDerek Luke takes the role of the humble family man and refinery foreman who - by comparison - has done well for a black man with a car and even and camera to show for his hard graft.\nHowever, following a terrorist strike on his workplace - the Secunda refinery east of Johannesburg - Chamusso was arrested by the South African security forces.\nSuspected of having helped the ANC gain access to the plant, he was denied access to a lawyer and tortured by goons run by police colonel Nic Vos (Robbins).\nIt was this experience that turned him from model worker and devoted family man to a anti-apartheid agitator offering his services to the ANC.\nUtilising his knowledge of the refinery, Chamusso is sent (by Joe Slovo himself) on a sabotage mission little suspecting that Vos is watching his every move.\nDirector Philip Noyce's straightforward political thriller is a salutary reminder of the vile regime which held sway in South Africa just a couple of decades ago.\nRather than a living, breathing character, Robbins' Vos is an amalgam of the unpalatable facets of the Afrikaner regime, the demeanour of an urbane white man masking the capacity for unrestrained cruelty.\nChamusso is a more complex personality, whose flaws (an affair with an attractive neighbour) lend him authenticity and make his transition from observer to participant all the more believable.\nA simple tale well told, it's a fair guess that the late Joe Slovo would have approved.\nTim Evans.",

It's the ideal place for Will (Glenn Howerton) to get inspiration and ideas and moon over the girl of his dreams (Friday Night Lights hotwire Adrienne Palicki). But while constant hassle from the obnoxious barista (stand-up star Josh Groban) is a small price to pay for free wi-fi, if the owner goes through with his plan to turn Coffee Town into a swanky bistro, bang goes everybody's business. Witty banter abounds in Arrested Development writer Brad Copeland's directing debut.",
